- Encoder-Decoder Model [*Setup*]
    - Generate encoder output by running the input through the encoder
    - Generate the decoder input ids by setting them to bos token


- **Contrastive Loss** 
    - An alternative to KL divergence, focusing on rank-order logit alignment to improve speculative decoding stability and efficiency
